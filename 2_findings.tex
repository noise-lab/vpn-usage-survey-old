\paragraph{Ratings}

As stated in the method section, we asked our participants to assess their
willingness to Hotspot Shield on the scale from 1 to 5 (1 being the less likely
and 5 very likely) three times: 1) after completing a set of tasks using the
VPN, 2) after completing another set of task using the VPN and VPNAudit, and
3) after explaining how trackers get data about their online activity
while using the VPN and giving additional information about how our tool and the VPN work.  The participants gave a median score of 3.25, 3.75, and 2.5 for each measurement, respectively. Nine participants did not change their scores between the
first and second measurements, with two that did not change their scores at
all between the 3 measurements. One participant was more willing to use the
VPN after the second measurement. Another participant was more willing to
use the VPN after the information we presented about Hotspot Shield's questionable privacy practices in the 3rd measurement.  In the following paragraphs, we deeper into the participants' reasoning for their scores.

\paragraph{VPNAudit mostly did not change views on privacy}

After setting up Hotspot Shield, we asked our participants to complete a set of tasks without being shown VPNAudit. Participants scored a median of 3.25 on a scale
from 1 to 5 on how likely they would use Hotspot Shield. However, 5 participants believed that they did not need the VPN at all for the set of tasks we gave them, i.e. looking up information about movies, sexual health, and/or mental health. \AH{A quote from one of these 5 participants should go here.}

Interestingly, after completing the second set of tasks with VPNAudit, the participants' median score was 3.75, i.e. higher than the first measurement. P9 rated Hotspot Shield higher than after the first set of tasks because the VPN seemed easy to use and did not slow down the connection. Nonetheless, three participants rated the VPN lower than the
first measurement. Two participants changed their mind because of the information they saw on the extension and the fact that data was being sent to trackers, and one because
they felt that accessing websites was slower than during the first set of
tasks.

When asked if VPNAudit changed their perspective of how VPNs work, 7
participants agreed because they had believed VPNs do not keep records of their data. \AH{Agnieszka, can you confirm these numbers?} However, 4 participants did not feel like VPNAudit changed their opinion of Hotspot Shield because they were not concerned about privacy. \AH{A quote from of of these 4 participants should go here}.

\paragraph{Articles changed views on privacy}

After completing the first two sets of tasks, participants were finally asked to read articles
about the privacy practices of Hotspot Shield. Then, they were asked to rate
their willingness to use the VPN in the future. Participants scored a median
of 2.5, i.e. lower than the first two measurements. Six participants' scores were
lower because of the information they received from the articles.

Notably, 7 participants felt deceived when they learned about the fact that
VPNs send information to trackers but they do not mention it explicitly on
their websites. Six of our participants would be more willing to use the VPN
if the company was transparent about the fact, that using free version of VPN
results in sending data to advertisers. \AH{A quote from one of the 6 participants should go here.} Five participants would still not use such a
VPN, but they would appreciate such information and trust the VPN company
more.

On the other hand, two participants--P1 and P11--gave the same score because they were not concerned about their privacy. As P1 explained, their browsing history would be sent to trackers regardless if they used Hotspot Shield or not.
For P11, it was more important whether VPNs are easy to use, cheap, and allow
them to access blocked content. \AH{A quote for this participant should go here.}

% On the other hand, P5 gave a better rating after reading the articles. As P5 explained:

% \begin{quote}A VPN, even if it allows information to these two trackers, it
% still takes care of your other information. It doesn't allow other information
% that are not sent to this tracker, and it encrypts that data.\end{quote} Five
% of our participants stated that even though they know VPN sends the data to
% trackers, at least it allows them to access the content they want.

% \paragraph{Speed and location are important}
% 
% While setting Hotspot Shield in Google Chrome, 9 participants stated that they were mostly interested in learning about the locations for the VPN that they could choose from. At least 3 participants did not like the fact that the free version of the VPN had a small number of locations to choose from. Furthermore, 2 participants did not like that the free version offered no U.S. location, and 1 participant indicated that they want a U.S. location to watch Netflix from abroad. Three participants were curious about pricing, and another 3 participants were looking for information about the speed of Hotspot Shield.

% After completing the first set of tasks, 5 participants believed that using Hotspot Shield made their online experience too slow. Again, 2 participants complained that the VPN did not have enough locations to choose from. Overall, the participants felt quite neutral towards the VPN.
% Even after completing another set of tasks with VPNAudit, eight participants' rating remained the same. \AH{A quote would be good here.}

\paragraph{Participants did not understand how VPNs work}

While looking around the website for Hotspot Shield, 8 participants admitted that they did not trust all of the VPN's promises. In particular, they did not believe
that Hotspot Shield provides unlimited bandwidth and/or that it ensures anonymity.
Moreover, 7 participants were confused, since they did not understand the content
on the website (5) and were not sure how the VPN works (4). At least one person
felt uncertain about the VPN being legal. One participant also said that
they would appreciate a comparison between different VPNs so that they could make an
informed decision.

After completing both sets of tasks, P9 and P7--who rated Hotspot Shield the same way for both measurements--believed that trackers are not able to see their real IP
addresses. Thus, they believed they were not being tracked while using Hotspot Shield, and that the tool just listed trackers that are embedded on websites they visit. \AH{A quote would be great here.}

Seven of our participants were also not sure how VPNAudit works or what
information it was presenting. For example, 2 participants, P11 and P2,
thought that VPNAudit is tracker that collects data. Eight participants
explained that it shows "hits" sent to trackers, but they did not elaborate on what this means. \AH{Agnieszka, can you confirm these numbers?}
