Virtual private networks are designed to extend a network securely from a private location, such as a business or home, across a public network, as if the network were directly linked. VPNs are popular among consumers for obfuscating their real location, whether to access geo-blocked services or bypass censorship or other restrictions. Among enterprises, VPNs are often set up to allow employees to access corporate intranets while travelling or working from home.},
