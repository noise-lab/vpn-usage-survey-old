\subsection{Recruitment} 
How we recruited participants

% We recruited interview participants through emailing listservs of our institution's survey center, Twitter and we also posted an advertisement on  our research lab' website. 
% We filtered for students who had used a VPN before; were students currently enrolled in a US university undergraduate or graduate program.
% We aim to recruit a variety of international and domestic students living in the United States.
% We concluded that such diverse group would expand our knowledge and understanding on how and why participants use VPN. 
% All interviews were audio-taped and participants were compensated with a $20$.

% For the survey, we recruited undergraduate and graduate students from our institution.
% We sent email invitations to a random sample of 2,748 people in this audience, and included a note in the email to filter for VPN users who are over the age of 18.
% We collected 452 responses, of which 392 were generated by respondents who fit our criteria.
% Of these 392 responses, 356 were fully completed.
% Of the 356 complete responses, 350 passed our attention checks and are considered valid responses for the purposes of analysis.

\subsection{Survey} 
Description of pre-study survey

% Before participating in an interview, participants were asked to fill out a consent form and a short survey, where we collected data about their demographic information and their general online habits and behavior.
% Our interviews were semi-structured, so we asked all participants the same set of questions and asked additional follow-up questions whenever it was needed.
% To get a better understanding of participants' knowledge and background, we  first asked about participants' general privacy and security awareness.
% Next, we asked how participants choose to use a particular VPN and why they use them.
