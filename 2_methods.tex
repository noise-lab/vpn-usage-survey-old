In order to better understand how students think about privacy when choosing between VPN providers (or "VPNs"), we designed a small-scale lab experiment. \AH{I don't think "experiment" is the right word, but I'm using it for now.}
The results of the interviews and the survey described in sections~\ref{} suggest that privacy is not of significant concern to students when choosing a VPN provider to use.
Nonetheless, we were interested in seeing if students would value privacy more if they were given more information about the privacy practices of VPN providers.

\subsection{Recruitment} 
We once again recruited participants through listservs maintained by our institution's survey center.
We filtered for students who had used a VPN before and were currently undergraduate or graduate students at our institution.
All interviews were audio-taped, and participants were compensated with a \$20 Amazon gift card.

In total, 64 people responded to our recruitment e-mails.
Of these respondents, 5 had participated in either the survey or the interview portion of our study, so they were not eligible to participate in our experiment.
One of the respondents was also not a student, so they were not eligible to participate in our experiment.

We were able to conduct our experiment with 14 of the 65 eligible participants. 
Unfortunately, one of the experiments was conducted in a noisy setting, which may have influenced the participant's responses.
We also later discovered that one of the participants we conducted the experiment with had also participated in the survey portion of our study.
This left us with valid data from 12 participants to analyze.

\subsection{Survey} 
Description of pre-study survey

% Before participating in an interview, participants were asked to fill out a consent form and a short survey, where we collected data about their demographic information and their general online habits and behavior.
% Our interviews were semi-structured, so we asked all participants the same set of questions and asked additional follow-up questions whenever it was needed.
% To get a better understanding of participants' knowledge and background, we  first asked about participants' general privacy and security awareness.
% Next, we asked how participants choose to use a particular VPN and why they use them.
