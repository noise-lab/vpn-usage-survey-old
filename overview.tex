\section{Study Overview}\label{sec:overview}

We conducted a two part study to answer our research questions:  in-depth interviews and  a large-scale survey with college students about their VPN usage and a laboratory study to understand how users react to seeing whether a VPN is meeting with its expected data protection and privacy policies. All portions of the study were IRB-approved by our institution and required consent to participate.
