\section{Study Overview}

We aimed to use the interview component to collect in-depth, qualitative data from a small number of students. We interviewed 32 foreign and domestic students at Princeton who used VPN for 30-60 minutes on a broad spectrum of questions spanning privacy and security awareness, experiences with and knowledge of VPNs, challenges of VPN usage, and improvements to VPNs. We analyzed the transcripts and used early findings to inform the design of a larger-scale survey of Princeton students to collect more generalizable quantitative data of 350 students. After the survey launch, we designed and ran an in-lab experiment to test studentsâ€™ perceptions of VPN data leakage and collection. In this experiment, TODO students were interviewed before and after being shown consequences of their VPN usage via a custom-built software tool. Through the lab experiment, we aimed to collect more in-depth data on VPN perception and flaws to complement our prior results.
